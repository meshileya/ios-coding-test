In this Solution, Pure Swift 5 was actually used in implementing this project since SwiftUI can only work on iOS ~>13 for now.

I had to ensure it works on both iPhones and i-pads while having to consider change in orientation as well.

If I had more time, I would have also used Room to serve as the local DB while consideirng the repository pattern as well.
